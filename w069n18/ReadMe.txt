MDLR - La Romana Airport -first version-
----------------------------------------

How to install the scenery?

Copy the files and put it in the following directory:
Flightgear -> data -> Scenery -> Objects -> w070n10 -> w069n18

Be sure that you replace the stg-file named "1825560" otherwise it won't work later.

Have fun with many flights to La Romana Airport.

If there are question or problems you can mail me in Lukas' Flightgear Hangar.
